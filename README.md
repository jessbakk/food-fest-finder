## Problems

* **Current "issues** - Outdated Heroku stack, in process of updating to latest Heroku stack version

## Planned Enhancements/Features

* **Add More Google Map Features** - Currently, the map markers and the festivals are not connected. Planned enhancement to highlight the marker when the current event is in view. 

* **Vendor Options** - Allow a distinction between Vendors and Users.

* **Quick Link/Button to ADD EVENT** - Adding events is available when directly navigating to the '/addevent' page by typing in the URL. Plan to add a button option to allow users and vendors the ability to add event while they are signed in. 

* **Edit/Delete Events** - Vendors or users that created the event will have the ability to edit or delete events.

* **Comment on Events** - Allow comments on events for logged in users
